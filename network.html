        <h2>What Networking Is?</h2>
        <p>
        Networking can feel intimidating, especially if you associate it with “selling yourself.”
        In reality, networking is simply a way to learn from others and build professional relationships over time.
        </p>
          <h3>Networking is...</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Learning from others</strong> by asking thoughtful questions about roles, teams, and career paths.</li>
                <li><strong>Building relationships over time</strong> through small, consistent interactions and follow-ups.</li>
                <li><strong>Being specific and respectful</strong> about what you are asking for (time, advice, or resources).</li>
                <li><strong>Offering value when you can</strong>, such as sharing a relevant article, thanking someone, or staying connected.</li>
                <li><strong>Practicing curiosity</strong>—focusing on understanding someone’s experience rather than impressing them.</li>
            </ul>
          <h3>Networking isn’t...</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Asking for a job in the first message</strong> without building any context or connection.</li>
                <li><strong>Sending the same message to many people</strong> without personalizing it to their background or role.</li>
                <li><strong>Trying to “pitch” yourself</strong> with long paragraphs or excessive details.</li>
                <li><strong>Expecting immediate replies</strong>—many people are busy, and follow-up is normal.</li>
                <li><strong>Only reaching out when you need something</strong>, rather than maintaining relationships over time.</li>
            </ul>
        <p>
            <strong>Tip:</strong> If you’re not sure what to say, start with a simple goal: learn one new thing.
            A short message and a clear question is often enough to begin a connection.
        </p>

        <h2>A Simple Networking Pathway</h2>
          <p>
            Networking does not need to be overwhelming. Following a simple, repeatable
            process can help you take action with confidence and reduce uncertainty at each step.
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
            <strong>Prepare</strong><br>
            Identify your goal, such as learning about a role or industry, and prepare a short
            introduction about who you are. Think about one or two questions you genuinely
            want to ask before reaching out.
            </li>

            <li>
            <strong>Reach Out</strong><br>
            Send a brief and personalized message that explains why you are reaching out and
            what you are hoping to learn. Respect the other person’s time by keeping your
            message clear and concise.
            </li>

            <li>
            <strong>Meet and Learn</strong><br>
            Use the conversation to listen, ask thoughtful questions, and understand the
            person’s experience. Focus on learning rather than asking for opportunities or favors.
            </li>

            <li>
            <strong>Follow Up and Stay Connected</strong><br>
            After the conversation, send a short thank-you message and reflect on what you
            learned. Staying in touch occasionally helps turn a single interaction into a lasting
            professional connection.
            </li>

        <h2>Outreach Email Templates</h2>
            <p>
                Reaching out to someone new can feel intimidating, but a short and thoughtful message is often enough to start a conversation. The templates below can be customized to fit your situation.

                have time to connect.<br><br>
                Best regards,<br>
                [Your Name]
                </p>

            <h3>Follow-Up After an Event</h3>

                Hello [Name],<br><br>
                It was great meeting you at [event]. I enjoyed our conversation about [topic] and

                questions if you are available.<br><br>
                Thank you,<br>
                [Your Name]
                </p>

    <h2>Informational Interviews Using TIARA</h2>

    <p>
        Informational interviews are conversations focused on learning rather than job
        searching. The TIARA framework helps you ask thoughtful questions while keeping
        the discussion natural and respectful.
    </p>

    <dl>
        <dt><strong>T – Trends</strong></dt>
        <dd>
        Ask about changes or patterns in the industry or role.
        <em>Example:</em> What trends are currently shaping your team or field?
        </dd>

        <dt><strong>I – Insights</strong></dt>
        <dd>
        Learn what the work is really like on a day-to-day basis.
        <em>Example:</em> What has surprised you most about this role?
        </dd>

        <dt><strong>A – Advice</strong></dt>
        <dd>
        Seek guidance based on their experience.
        <em>Example:</em> What skills or experiences would you recommend developing?
        </dd>

        <dt><strong>R – Resources</strong></dt>
        <dd>
        Ask about tools, materials, or communities that are helpful.
        <em>Example:</em> Are there resources you recommend for someone entering this field?
        </dd>

        <dt><strong>A – Assignments</strong></dt>
        <dd>
        Request small, low-pressure next steps.
        <em>Example:</em> Is there someone else you suggest I speak with?
        </dd>
    </dl>

    <p>
        Using TIARA can help keep conversations focused on learning and relationship
        building rather than immediate outcomes.
